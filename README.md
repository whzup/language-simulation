## Language Evolution
This is a language evolution simulator inspired by https://github.com/fatiherikli/language-evolution-simulation. It has a similar graphical interface and agents that move randomly around. Every agent belongs to one of the three islands. This is indicated by its colour.
If you want to contribute feel free to have a look into the issues section.

**Planned features:**

* Add a data structure or algorithm to find the nearest neighbours more efficiently.
* Add a more efficient way to communicate between agents.
* Agents from the same island should speak in the island dialect.
* Agents from different island should be able to speak in a lingua franca to each other.
* The changed words should appear in a log inside the GUI.
* Words should have Etymology so one can view their history.
* Agents should be able to talk in sentences

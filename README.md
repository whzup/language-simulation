## Language Evolution
This is a language evolution simulator inspired by https://github.com/fatiherikli/language-evolution-simulation. It has a similar graphical interface and agents that move randomly around. Every agent belongs to one of the three islands. This is indicated by its colour.
If you want to contribute feel free to have a look into the issues section.

**Planned features:**

* Add a data structure to find the nearest neighbours more efficiently (maybe a QuadTree?).
* Add a more efficient way to communicate between agents.
* Add a island-based vocabulary.
* Add a lingua franca in which agents from different islands can talk to each other.
* Add a log for the exchanged words.
* Add Etymology for the words so one can view the history of different words.

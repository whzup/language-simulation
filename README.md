## Language Evolution
This is a language evolution simulator inspired by https://github.com/fatiherikli/language-evolution-simulation. It has a similar graphical interface and agents that move randomly around. Every agent belongs to one of the three islands indicated by its colour.

Planned features are:

* Add a data structure to find the nearest neighbours more efficiently (maybe a QuadTree?).
* Add a more efficient way to communicate between agents.
* Add a island-based vocabulary.
* Add a lingua franca in which agents from different islands can talk to each other.

If you build things on top of this project I'd be glad to see it!

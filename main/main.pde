/* TODO - Make the agent search more efficient. Maybe just check the neighbor
          cells for every agent instead of checking the whole map for every agent
          
        - Make the doubleConsonant method more efficient. It always checks every
          letter even if it doesn't act.
           
        - Make the map displaying more efficient.

        - solve all the word mutations with StringLists instead of
           character arrays

        - doubleConsonant is very complex. Maybe think of an easier way
           to implement it

        - you cannot jump from j to o -> from a to Ã¤ or to o

        - change the vowels of diphtongs

        - method which checks if the word has changed so it can be
           inserted in the etym array (hard) -> maybe create class-wide
            variables with random words so they can be checked inside the
             class

        - create a method to mutate the begin or the end of a word if
           it is often used with another word with a vowel on the beginning
            or the end
             -> maybe use another class to create sentences

        - maybe give certain letters a higher probability to be picked
           in the different languages

        - maybe include mountain regions which have a slower walking rate?
